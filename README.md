# Marketing Campaign Statistics Project

As part of my statistics course, I worked on a full **data analysis pipeline**. Below is a summary of the key steps I took to complete the project:

## Steps Involved:

### 1. Data Import:
- Loaded data directly from **MySQL** using `mysql.connector`.

### 2. Data Preprocessing:
- **Outlier Treatment:** Applied the **IQR method** while considering business context.
- **Missing Values:** Replaced missing values based on **customer segmentation** to maintain data integrity.

### 3. Customer Segmentation:
- Identified key customer groups to effectively **target marketing campaigns**.

### 4. A/B Testing:
- Performed A/B testing with the following parameters:
  - **Significance Level (α):** 0.05
  - **Power:** 0.8
  - **Effect Size:** 0.4

### 5. Inferential Statistics in Python:
- Wrote custom code to perform **hypothesis testing** and interpret the results.
- When the **p-value < α**, I rejected the **null hypothesis**, providing **data-driven support** for the marketing campaign.

🔍 This project provided me with **hands-on experience** in applying statistical methods to real-world business problems, enhancing my skills in **data analysis**, **hypothesis testing**, and **customer segmentation**.
