# Marketing-Campaign-Statistics-Project:

As part of my statistics course, I worked on a full data analysis pipeline. Here's what I accomplished:

Data Import: Loaded data directly from MySQL using mysql.connector.

Data Preprocessing:
Treated outliers using the IQR method with business context in mind.
Replaced missing values based on customer segmentation.

Customer Segmentation: Identified key customer groups to target marketing campaigns effectively.

A/B Testing:
Performed A/B testing with:
Significance level (α) = 0.05
Power = 0.8
Effect size = 0.4

Inferential Statistics in Python:
Wrote code to conduct hypothesis testing and interpret the results.
When the p-value < α, I rejected the null hypothesis – providing data-driven support for the campaign.

🔍 This project gave me hands-on experience in applying statistics to real-world problems.
